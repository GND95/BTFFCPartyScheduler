**How it works:**<br/>
This program opens with a calendar. You select a date, press enter, and it will bring up a form for that specific day. You can enter in information to schedule large groups of people and it will automatically save it to text files and pull from those files when you click on that same date at a later time.<br/>

**Description:**<br>
A very specific C# application I created to help improve the efficiency of a local business. The target operating system was Windows XP so debugging and testing was done on an XP virtual machine targeting .NET Framework Version 4.0 (latest supported major version for XP). This program assists in printing the required paperwork to ease the scheduling of numerous large groups of people at this business. <br/>

This application reads and writes to text files to save current and past party scheduling information. I designed and created the diagram used in the background then used Visual Studio & C# to modify that image to visually assist employees in scheduling large groups of people. The square and circle icons are drawn to scale and represent tables that people rent for parties at this business.
